reduce reuse refurbished
-This app will search through a pre set seeded database of multiple options for students to look through and find a matching computer/ipad that fits their budget.
-would like to include a staging shopping cart that allows full CRUD to push the final requests into a mock checkout scenario.
-i plan to add a search function that returns whatever the user is looking for in that product such as price, model and manufacture date.
-post MVP i would love to be able to incorporate this into a front end HTML CSS model to better show off my project.

i plan to manually make a API that has the inventory of the refurbished items.
i will do research on the most popular apple products for students and what is in demand. 
i can also possibly add in post MVP a way for a user to "sell" their old used products and update it to the inventory database.
